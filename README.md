## TODO

- [x] client-server protocol
- [x] greeting room
- [x] rooms
- [ ] autorization

## Currect state

Currently, work on the project has been suspended. at some point, I realized that inventing your own client-server protocol is a bad idea, moreover, this protocol is tied to the programming language, Rust. after that I lost the motivation to develop this project.
